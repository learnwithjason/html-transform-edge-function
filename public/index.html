      <h1>A Treatise on Pizza</h1>

      <p>
        It is empirically provable that pizza is the superior foodstuff. In this
        essay I will lay out the data-driven case for pizza’s scientific
        superiority.
      </p>

      <h2>Exhibit A: Melty Cheese</h2>

      <p>
        There’s nothing better in life than melty cheese. It has been proven: in
        a study conducted at my friend’s house, rats were offered a choice
        between a document containing the true meaning of life and a small
        amount of melty cheese. The rats chose the melty cheese
        <em>every time</em> — it doesn’t get more conclusive than that.
      </p>

      <p>
        In another study, I asked my friends to write a list of the things they
        were most willing to suffer for. 87% of respondents were willing to
        suffer intestinal distress if it meant they could eat more cheese.
      </p>

      <h2>Exhibit B: Salty Meats</h2>

        alt="a pepperoni pizza"
      />

      <p>
        The presence of a savory, salty ingredient adds a distinct advantage for
        pizza over lesser foodstuffs. If you’ve ever wondered why just about
        every restaurant table includes a salt shaker, but they rarely contain a
        shaker of, like, rosemary, it’s because the human palate has evolved to
        recognize the best flavors, and the best flavors are salty.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a study where half of participants were given a salt shaker filled
        with salt, and the other half of participants were given a salt shaker
        filled with granulated sugar, 100% of respondents were very upset with
        me for putting sugar in a salt shaker.
      </p>
      <p>This is evidence that 100% of people prefer salt.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion: Pizza Is the Best Food</h2>

      <p>
        Based on the ironclad scientific evidence above, we can conclude with
        absolute certainty that pizza, which is basically melty cheese and salty
        meats on bread (which is the second-best foodstuff), is the best
        foodstuff.
